## Brief overview

## How to use it?

You should have npm installed on your system and the browser you are using should have an metamask extension installed.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:themanavshah/DApp-template.git
```

```bash
cd DApp-template
```

```bash
npm install
```
You have to add **Infura API key in src/web3.js** before you run npm start.

If you want to re-deploy contracts then add your infura API key and secret key phase in deploy.js. After deploying change the contract address and json file in src/lottery.json

Make sure you are **logged into metamask extension** on your browser before you run this on your local host or else it will throw and error.

```bash
npm start
```
