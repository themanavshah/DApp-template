## Accroding to instagram post
- **contracts/** is the smart contract(s) written
- **compile.js** will compile your contract(s) manually and the resulting JSON will be saved in build/.
- **test/lottery.test.js** is the tests for the smart contract(s).
- **deploy.js** is the file for manually deploying contracts, it will log the contract address, which will be your contract address deployed on rinkeby test-net.
- **src** it is react stuff which is pretty understanble on how to create an react app.

## How to use it?

You have to npm installed on your system and the browser you are using should have an metamask extension.


```bash
git clone git@github.com:themanavshah/DApp-template.git
```

```bash
cd DApp-template
```

```bash
npm install
```
You have to add **Infura API key in src/web3.js** before you run npm start.

If you want to re-deploy contracts then add your infura API key and secret key phase in deploy.js. After deploying change the contract address and json file in src/lottery.json

Make sure you are **logged into metamask extension** on your browser before you run this on your local host or else it will throw and error.

```bash
npm start
```
